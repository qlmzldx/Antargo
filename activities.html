            <h1> Antarctic meteorite expedition</h1>
            <p>A meteorite is a solid piece of debris from an object, such as a comet, asteroid, or meteoroid, that originates in outer space and survives its passage through the atmosphere to reach the surface of a planet or moon. When the original object
                enters the atmosphere, various factors such as friction, pressure, and chemical interactions with the atmospheric gases cause it to heat up and radiate energy. It then becomes a meteor and forms a fireball, also known as a shooting star
                or falling star; astronomers call the brightest examples "bolides". Once it settles on the larger body's surface, the meteor becomes a meteorite. Meteorites vary greatly in size. For geologists, a bolide is a meteorite large enough to
                create an impact crater.</p>
            <p>Meteorites have traditionally been divided into three broad categories: stony meteorites that are rocks, mainly composed of silicate minerals; iron meteorites that are largely composed of metallic iron-nickel; and stony-iron meteorites that
                contain large amounts of both metallic and rocky material. Modern classification schemes divide meteorites into groups according to their structure, chemical and isotopic composition and mineralogy. Meteorites smaller than 2 mm are classified
                as micrometeorites. Extraterrestrial meteorites have been found on the Moon and on Mars.</p>
            <p>A few meteorites were found in Antarctica between 1912 and 1964. In 1969, the 10th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition found nine meteorites on a blue ice field near the Yamato Mountains. With this discovery, came the realization that movement
                of ice sheets might act to concentrate meteorites in certain areas.[38] After a dozen other specimens were found in the same place in 1973, a Japanese expedition was launched in 1974 dedicated to the search for meteorites. This team recovered
                nearly 700 meteorites.</p>
            <p>As an explorer, you will experience a 5-day treasure hunt under the leadership of a geologist. This project includes a 2-day geology course and a 3-day field experience. All the gems you find during the project belong to you</p>

            <p>We use three similar aircraft for flight operations: the BAE 146-200, the AVRO RJ 85, and the AVRO RJ 100. These aircraft were manufactured in the United Kingdom by British Aerospace (which later became part of BAE Systems). They are high-wing
                aircraft with short runway requirements, which means they are particularly suited for this kind of destination. They are operated by Aerovías DAP, which has more than 25 years of experience flying in Patagonia and Antarctica.</p>

            <p>8 Whales You Might See during Your Antarctica CruiseThey’re powerful. They’re beautiful. Some of them are really really big. Whales are a wonder of the natural world. Whale-watching is one of the great draws on an Antarctica cruise along with
                bird-watching, taking in the landscapes, tracing humanity’s exploratory history, and making friends with all of the other creatures of the Antarctic wild. Here’s a quick look at some of the whale species you’ll have the chance to encounter
                as you cruise through the Antarctic waters. Which species you see and how many of each type depends of course on the weather, the ice, the particular cruise you take, and whether or not the whales themselves are feeling friendly on any
                particular day.</p>

            </h1>
            <img class="pic" src="./images/igloo.png" alt="">
            <p>The igloo is the home of the Newt people. In Antarctica, you will have the opportunity to build an igloo yourself and stay overnight in the igloo. Of course, this is safe and environmentally friendly. All your construction progress will be
                carried out with the help and guidance of the indigenous people and staff</p>
            <p>The snow used to build an igloo must have enough structural strength to be cut and stacked appropriately. The best snow to use for this purpose is snow which has been blown by wind, which can serve to compact and interlock the ice crystals;
                snow that has settled gently to the ground in still weather is not useful. The hole left in the snow where the blocks are cut is usually used as the lower half of the shelter. Snow's insulating properties enable the inside of the igloo
                to remain relatively warm. In some cases, a single block of clear freshwater ice is inserted to allow light into the igloo. Igloos used as winter shelters had beds made of loose snow, skins, and caribou furs.[14] Sometimes, a short tunnel
                is constructed at the entrance, to reduce wind and heat loss when the door is opened. Animal skins or a snow block can be used as a door.

            <p>The aurora australis is more commonly seen in Australia around the time of maxima in the aproximatly11-year cycle in solar sunspot occurrence. Tasmania is the Australian state from which the aurora australis is most commonly seen, as it is
                closest to the normal location of the auroral oval.

            </p>
            <p>
                The global distribution of auroral activity is an oval around the magnetic poles in both hemispheres. As the level of magnetic disturbance of the Earth’s magnetic field increases, the oval of auroral activity expands equator-ward. At times it expands
                over Tasmania. The most dramatic displays will most likely be observed when the aurora is overhead at around midnight. The earlier in the evening an auroral display is seen in the southern sky, the more likely it is that the display will
                be more spectacular and more overhead (or even to the north) at around midnight.
